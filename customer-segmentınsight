Medium segment generates the highest total revenue, despite not having the highest order count.
This indicates a stronger average basket value compared to other segments.
Low segment creates a high number of orders but contributes less to total sales, suggesting lower basket values and price-sensitive behavior.
Improving cross-sell and up-sell strategies for the Low segment could significantly increase overall revenue.
